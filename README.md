# A/B Smartly SDK

A/B Smartly - Python SDK

## Compatibility

The A/B Smartly Python SDK is compatible with Python 3.
It provides both a blocking and an asynchronous interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Install the SDK
 ```bash
 pip install absmartly==0.1.2
 ```

### Dependencies
```
setuptools~=60.2.0  
requests~=2.28.1  
urllib3~=1.26.12  
jsons~=1.6.3
```



## Import and Initialize the SDK

Once the SDK is installed, it can be initialized in your project.
```python
    def main():
        client_config = ClientConfig()
        client_config.endpoint = "https://sandbox.test.io/v1"
        client_config.api_key = "test"
        client_config.application = "www"
        client_config.environment = "prod"
    
        default_client_config = DefaultHTTPClientConfig()
        default_client = DefaultHTTPClient(default_client_config)
        sdk_config = ABSmartlyConfig()
        sdk_config.client = Client(client_config, default_client)
        sdk = ABSmartly(sdk_config)
    
        context_config = ContextConfig()
        ctx = sdk.create_context(context_config)
```

#### Using a custom Event Logger
The A/B Smartly SDK can be instantiated with an event logger used for all contexts.
In addition, an event logger can be specified when creating a particular context, in the `ContextConfig`.
```python
    class EventType(Enum):
        ERROR = "error"
        READY = "ready"
        REFRESH = "refresh"
        PUBLISH = "publish"
        EXPOSURE = "exposure"
        GOAL = "goal"
        CLOSE = "close"
    
    
    class ContextEventLogger:
    
        @abstractmethod
        def handle_event(self, event_type: EventType, data: object):
            raise NotImplementedError
```
The data parameter depends on the type of event.
Currently, the SDK logs the following events:

| event | when                                                       | data |
|:---: |------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| `Error` | `Context` receives an error                                | `Throwable` object |
| `Ready` | `Context` turns ready                                      | `ContextData` used to initialize the context |
| `Refresh` | `Context.refresh()` method succeeds                        | `ContextData` used to refresh the context |
| `Publish` | `Context.publish()` method succeeds                        | `PublishEvent` sent to the A/B Smartly event collector |
| `Exposure` | `Context.getTreatment()` method succeeds on first exposure | `Exposure` enqueued for publishing |
| `Goal` | `Context.track()` method succeeds                          | `GoalAchievement` enqueued for publishing |
| `Close` | `Context.close()` method succeeds the first time           | `null` |


## Create a New Context Request

**Synchronously**
```python
# define a new context request
    context_config = ContextConfig()
    context_config.publish_delay = 10
    context_config.refresh_interval = 5

    context_config = ContextConfig()
    ctx = sdk.create_context(context_config)
    ctx.wait_until_ready()
```

**Asynchronously**
```python
# define a new context request
    context_config = ContextConfig()
    context_config.publish_delay = 10
    context_config.refresh_interval = 5

    context_config = ContextConfig()
    ctx = sdk.create_context(context_config)
    ctx.wait_until_ready_async()
```

**With Prefetched Data**
```python
# define a new context request
    context_config = ContextConfig()
    context_config.publish_delay = 10
    context_config.refresh_interval = 5
    context_config.units = {"session_id": "bf06d8cb5d8137290c4abb64155584fbdb64d8",
                            "user_id": "12345"}
    
    context_config = ContextConfig()
    ctx = sdk.create_context(context_config)
    ctx.wait_until_ready_async()
```

**Refreshing the Context with Fresh Experiment Data**
For long-running contexts, the context is usually created once when the application is first started.
However, any experiments being tracked in your production code, but started after the context was created, will not be triggered.
To mitigate this, we can use the `set_refresh_interval()` method on the context config.

```python
    default_client_config = DefaultHTTPClientConfig()
    default_client_config.refresh_interval = 5
```

Alternatively, the `refresh()` method can be called manually.
The `refresh()` method pulls updated experiment data from the A/B Smartly collector and will trigger recently started experiments when `get_treatment()` is called again.
```python
    context.refresh()
```

**Setting Extra Units**
You can add additional units to a context by calling the `set_unit()` or the `set_units()` method.
This method may be used for example, when a user logs in to your application, and you want to use the new unit type to the context.
Please note that **you cannot override an already set unit type** as that would be a change of identity, and will throw an exception. In this case, you must create a new context instead.
The `SetUnit()` and `SetUnits()` methods can be called before the context is ready.

```python
    context.set_unit("db_user_id", "1000013")
    
    context.set_units({
            "db_user_id": "1000013"
    })
```

## Basic Usage

#### Selecting a treatment
```python
    res, _ = context.get_treatment("exp_test_experiment")
    if res == 0:
            # user is in control group (variant 0)
    else:
           # user is in treatment group
```

### Treatment Variables

```python
     res = context.get_variable_value(key, 17)
```


#### Peek at treatment variants
Although generally not recommended, it is sometimes necessary to peek at a treatment or variable without triggering an exposure.
The A/B Smartly SDK provides a `peek_treament()` method for that.

```python
    res = context.peek_treament("exp_test_experiment")
    if res == 0:
        # user is in control group (variant 0)
    else:
        # user is in treatment group

```
##### Peeking at variables
```python
    variable = context.peek_variable("my_variable")
```

#### Overriding treatment variants
During development, for example, it is useful to force a treatment for an experiment. This can be achieved with the `override()` and/or `overrides()` methods.
The `set_override()` and `set_overrides()` methods can be called before the context is ready.
```python
    context.set_override("exp_test_experiment", 1) # force variant 1 of treatment
    context.set_overrides({
        "exp_test_experiment": 1,
        "exp_another_experiment": 0
    })
```

## Advanced

### Context Attributes
Attributes are used to pass meta-data about the user and/or the request.
They can be used later in the Web Console to create segments or audiences.
The `set_attributes()` and `set_attributes()` methods can be called before the context is ready.
```python
    context.set_attributes("user_agent", req.get_header("User-Agent"))
    
    context.set_attributes({
            "customer_age": "new_customer"
    })
```

### Custom Assignments

Sometimes it may be necessary to override the automatic selection of a
variant. For example, if you wish to have your variant chosen based on
data from an API call. This can be accomplished using the
`set_custom_assignment()` method.

```python
    context.set_custom_assignment("exp_test_not_eligible", 3)
```

If you are running multiple experiments and need to choose different
custom assignments for each one, you can do so using the
`set_custom_assignments()` method.

```python
    context.set_custom_assignments({"db_user_id2": 1})
```

### Publish
Sometimes it is necessary to ensure all events have been published to the A/B Smartly collector, before proceeding.
You can explicitly call the `publish()` or `publish_async()` methods.
```python
    context.publish()
```

### Finalize
The `close()` and `close_async()` methods will ensure all events have been published to the A/B Smartly collector, like `publish()`, and will also "seal" the context, throwing an error if any method that could generate an event is called.
```python
    context.close()
```

### Tracking Goals
Goals are created in the A/B Smartly web console.
```python
    context.track("payment", {
            "item_count": 1,
            "total_amount": 1999.99
    })
```
